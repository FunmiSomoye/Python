# Python
My first attempts at writing a python script for something other than data analysis.\
As part of assignment from She Code Africa Mentorship program.\
\
I am open and will appreciate feedback from anyone.\

\
I used pylint for code cleaning.\
I also made sure to validate all user inputs and to modularise my codes.\

## General Summaries
#### A Guessing Game
This is a very simple computer game that allows a user guess a number randomly generated by the computer.\
I set my limit to 20 as was requuired for the task.\
\
You would really enjoy playing it.\

#### Secure password Generator
Crypto, banking, and many other sensitive applications all require secure passwords.\
In fact, Google now helps using a password generation engine to suggest passwords to users.\
I have also created a secure password generator.\
I made use of the secrets module as I read on stackoverflow that it is more secure than simply using random.choices.\
\
This password generator is very easy to use and very easy to replicate:\
simply tell it how many characters you want in your password,\ 
and how much of it should be made up of letters.\
And voila!

###### Dependencies
I am using Python 3.8.6
